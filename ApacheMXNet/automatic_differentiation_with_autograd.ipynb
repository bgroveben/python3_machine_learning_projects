    "In machine learning, we *train* models to get better and better as a function of experience.  \n",

    "With neural networks, we choose loss functions to be differentiable with respect to our parameters.  \n",
    "Put simply, this means that for each of the model's parameters, we can determine how much *increasing* or *decreasing* it might affect the loss.  \n",

    "_MXNet_'s `autograd` package expedites this work by automatically calculating derivatives.  \n",
    "And while most other libraries require that we compile a symbolic graph to take automatic derivatives, ``mxnet.autograd``, like PyTorch, allows you to take derivatives while writing  ordinary imperative code.  \n",
    "Every time you make a pass through your model, ``autograd`` builds a graph on the fly, through which it can immediately backpropagate gradients.  \n",
