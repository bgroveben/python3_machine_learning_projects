    "In some form or another, machine learning is all about making predictions.  \n",
    "We might want to predict the probability of a patient suffering a heart attack in the next year, given their clinical history.  \n",
    "In anomaly detection, we might want to assess how likely a set of readings from an airplane’s jet engine would be, were it operating normally.  \n",
    "In reinforcement learning, we want an agent to act intelligently in an environment.  \n",
    "This means we need to think about the probability of getting a high reward under each of the available action.  \n",
    "And when we build recommender systems we also need to think about probability.  \n",

    "In other words, our ability to tell cats and dogs apart at a large distance (and thus low resolution) might approach uninformed guessing.  \n",
    "Probability gives us a formal way of reasoning about our level of certainty.  \n",
    "If we are completely sure that the image depicts a cat, we say that the probability that the corresponding label l is cat, denoted $P(l=\\mathrm{cat})$ equals 1.0.  \n",
    "If we had no evidence to suggest that $l=\\mathrm{cat}$ or that $l=\\mathrm{dog}$, then we might say that the two possibilities were equally likely expressing this as $P(l=\\mathrm{cat})=0.5$.  \n",
    "If we were reasonably confident, but not sure that the image depicted a cat, we might assign a probability $.5<P(l=\\mathrm{cat})<1.0$."

    "In both cases, we have some value of interest.  \n",
    "And in both cases we are uncertain about the outcome.  \n",
    "But there’s a key difference between the two cases.  \n",
    "In this first case, the image is in fact either a dog or a cat, we just don’t know which.  \n",
    "In the second case, the outcome may actually be a random event, if you believe in such things (and most physicists do).  \n",
