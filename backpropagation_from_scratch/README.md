## [How to Implement the Backpropagation Algorithm From Scratch In Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-backpropagation-algorithm-scratch-python/)

The backpropagation algorithm is the classical feed-forward artificial neural network.  
It is the technique still used to train large [deep learning networks](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-deep-learning/).  
In this tutorial, you will discover how to implement the backpropagation algorithm from scratch with Python.  

After completing this tutorial, you will know:
- How to forward-propagate an input to calculate an output.
- How to back-propagate error and train a network.
- How to apply the backpropagation algorithm to a real-world predictive modeling problem.  

Letâ€™s get started.
