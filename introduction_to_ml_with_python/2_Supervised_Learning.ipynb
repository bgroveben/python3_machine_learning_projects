    "Overfitting occurs when you fit a model too closely to the particularities of the training set and come up with a model that works well on that training set but is not able to generalize to new data.  \n",
    "On the other hand, if your model is too simple or whose scope is too broadly defined, then you might not be able to capture all the aspects of and variability in the data.  \n",
    "This is known as [underfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting#Underfitting), and will result in your model performing poorly on both the training and test sets because it cannot capture the underlying trend of the data.  \n",
