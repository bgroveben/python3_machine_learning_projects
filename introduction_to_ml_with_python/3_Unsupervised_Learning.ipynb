    "**Unsupervised transformations** of a dataset are algorithms that create a new representation of the data which might be easier for humans or other machine learning algorithms to understand compared to the original representation of the data.  \n",

    "A common application for dimensionality reduction is reduction to two dimensions for visualization purposes.  \n",
    "Another application for unsupervised transformations is finding the parts or components that “make up” the data.  \n",
    "An example of this is topic extraction on collections of text documents.  \n",
    "Here, the task is to find the unknown topics that are talked about in each document, and to learn what topics appear in each document.  \n",

    "A major challenge in unsupervised learning is evaluating whether the algorithm learned something useful.  \n",
    "Unsupervised learning algorithms are usually applied to data that does not contain any label information, so we don’t know what the right output should be.  \n",
    "Therefore, it is very hard to say whether a model “did well.”  \n",
    "For example, our hypothetical clustering algorithm could have grouped together all the pictures that show faces in profile and all the full-face pictures.  \n",
    "This would certainly be a possible way to divide a collection of pictures of people’s faces, but it’s not the one we were looking for.  \n",
    "However, there is no way for us to “tell” the algorithm what we are looking for, and often the only way to evaluate the result of an unsupervised algorithm is to inspect it manually.  \n",
    "As a consequence, unsupervised algorithms are used often in an exploratory setting, when a data scientist wants to understand the data better, rather than as part of a larger automatic system.  \n",
    "Another common application for unsupervised algorithms is as a preprocessing step for supervised algorithms.  \n",
    "Learning a new representation of the data can sometimes improve the accuracy of supervised algorithms, or can lead to reduced memory and time consumption.\n",
    "Before we start with “real” unsupervised algorithms, we will briefly discuss some simple preprocessing methods that often come in handy.  \n",
    "Even though preprocessing and scaling are often used in tandem with supervised learning algorithms, scaling methods don’t make use of the supervised information, making them unsupervised."
