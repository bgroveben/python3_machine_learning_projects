    "In this example, we called `get_dummies()` on a `DataFrame` containing both the training and the test data.  \n",
    "This is important to ensure categorical values are represented in the same way in the training set and the test set.  \n",
    "Imagine we have the training and test sets in two different `DataFrames`.  \n",
    "If the `\"Private Employee\"` value for the `workclass` feature does not appear in the test set, `pandas` will assume there are only three possible values for this feature and will create only three new dummy features.  \n",
    "Now our training and test sets have different numbers of features, and we can’t apply the model we learned on the training set to the test set anymore.  \n",
    "Even worse, imagine the workclass feature has the values `\"Government Employee\"` and `\"Private Employee\"` in the training set, and `\"Self Employed\"` and `\"Self Employed Incorporated\"` in the test set.  \n",
    "In both cases, `pandas` will create two new dummy features, so the encoded `DataFrames` will have the same number of features.  \n",
    "However, the two dummy features have entirely different meanings in the training and test sets.  \n",
    "The column that means `\"Government Employee\"` for the training set would encode `\"Self Employed\"` for the test set.  \n",
    "If we built a machine learning model on this data it would work very badly, because it would assume the columns mean the same things (because they are in the same position) when in fact they mean very different things.  \n",
    "To fix this, either call `get_dummies()` on a DataFrame that contains both the training and the test data points, or make sure that the column names are the same for the training and test sets after calling `get_dummies()`, to ensure they have the same semantics."
