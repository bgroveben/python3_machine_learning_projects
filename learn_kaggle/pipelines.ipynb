    "Pipelines are a simple way to keep your data processing and modeling code organized.  \n",
    "Specifically, a pipeline bundles preprocessing and modeling steps so you can use the whole bundle as if it were a single step.  \n",
    "Many data scientists hack together models without pipelines, but Pipelines have some important benefits, including:  \n",
    "* **Cleaner Code:** You won't need to keep track of your training (and validation) data at each step of processing. Accounting for data at each step of processing can get messy. With a pipeline, you don't need to manually keep track of each step.  \n",
    "* **Fewer Bugs:** There are fewer opportunities to misapply a step or forget a pre-processing step.  \n",
    "* **Easier to Productionize:** It can be surprisingly hard to transition a model from a prototype to something deployable at scale. We won't go into the many related concerns here, but pipelines can help.  \n",
    "* **More Options For Model Testing:** You will see an example in the next tutorial, which covers cross-validation."
