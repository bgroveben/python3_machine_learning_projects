## Probabilistic Programming From Scratch

The code in this repo is from an [article by Mike Lee Williams](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/probabilistic-programming-from-scratch) courtesy of O'Reilly Media.  

The article gives a "from scratch" approach to a specific data analysis problem: a simple A/B test for a website.

You can learn more about probabilistic programming from [Probabilistic-Programming.org](http://probabilistic-programming.org/wiki/Home) as well as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming_language).  

The article refers to a [detailed report on the technology and uses of probabilistic programming in startups and enterprises](http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/01/18/new-research-on-probabilistic-programming.html) published in a blog post by Fast Forward Labs.  

I also found an online book called [Probabilistic Programming & Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/) that was linked from the [PyMC3 site](https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/).  

The author refers to a very informative [introduction to generators](https://nedbatchelder.com/text/iter.html).  

For faster and more efficient ways of doing probabilistic programming, here is [another blog post by Fast Forward Labs on the algorithms behind PP](http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/01/30/the-algorithms-behind-probabilistic-programming.html).
