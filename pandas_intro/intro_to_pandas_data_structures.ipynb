    "What follows is a fairly thorough introduction to the library.  \n",
    "I chose to break it into three parts as I felt it was too long and daunting as one.  \n",
    "* Part 1: Intro to pandas data structures, covers the basics of the library's two main data structures - Series and DataFrames.  \n",
    "* Part 2: Working with DataFrames, dives a bit deeper into the functionality of DataFrames. It shows how to inspect, select, filter, merge, combine, and group your data.  \n",
    "* Part 3: Using pandas with the MovieLens dataset, applies the learnings of the first two parts in order to answer a few basic analysis questions about the MovieLens ratings data.\n"
